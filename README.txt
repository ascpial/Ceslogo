Cesium logo editor for TI83 Premium CE (python version compatible)

-- USE --
You can use this program to create logos visible inside Cesium.

You first need to send the program CESLOGO.8xp to your calculator using an application like TI-Connect.

To create a logo, launch the program and choose a start color.
You can then edit you logo using the following keybinds:

-- KEYBINDS --
/\, \/, > et < : move the cursor.
mode           : change drawing mode. Availables modes are: one pixel at a time and brush which spread the color where your cursor goes.
2nd/alpha      : changer la couleur du pixel.
2nd/alpha      : change the pixel color.
sto>           : loads a logo if already saved.
suppr          : allows you to change the color of all pixels of the logo. Use keybinds /\ and \/ to change the filling color. Press enter to validate, and annul to cancel.
<>             : swap a color to another one. Use < and > to change selection. Use /\ and \/ to change the color. Press enter to validate, and annul to cancel.
tests          : show the logo as it will be displayed in cesium.
annul          : allows you to quit the program. The save menu is here, if the option yes is enabled.

-- SAVES --
To save the image, press annul, then "oui" (yes in french), in the save menu select "oui".
It is also possible to save using the tests button, by leaving the "oui" option enabled in the save menu.
